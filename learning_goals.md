# What Do You Want to Learn & Contribute? – Reflection

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?  
In a real-world setting, I wish to have hands-on cybersecurity experience. I'm particularly interested in finding out how Focus Bear uses vulnerability management, incident response, and security monitoring in daily operations. Additionally, I'm interested in how cybersecurity concepts fit into the QA and app development processes.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?  
- **Threat identification & analysis**: identifying dangers through the use of logs, monitoring tools, and alarms.  
- Learning how to test and protect apps like Focus Bear against common vulnerabilities is known as "application security."  
- **Secure QA practices** - knowing how cybersecurity and QA work together to ensure secure, stable, and safe releases.  

- Working with developers and QA testers to report, document, and resolve security vulnerabilities is an example of collaboration skills.  

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?  
- A strong foundation in **cybersecurity concepts** (Networking, IT Security, Malware Analysis).  
- **Hands-on skills** from labs and coursework (TryHackMe, Wireshark, Metasploit, SIEM basics).  
- A **detail-oriented mindset** for identifying risks, inconsistencies, and edge cases during testing.  
- Fresh perspectives on improving **security awareness** and privacy features within the app.  

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?  
My confidence in **large-scale log analysis and incident response** has decreased. Although I've honed these abilities in lab settings, I still want to get better at swiftly looking at actual security incidents, deciphering log data, and making practical suggestions.
## What does success in this internship look like for you?  
Success means:  
- Gaining practical experience and boosting my confidence in my cybersecurity abilities.  
- Assisting the Focus Bear team in enhancing user confidence and app security.  
- At least a few significant enhancements should be documented, such as identifying vulnerabilities, suggesting solutions, or enhancing QA-security procedures.  

- I'll be leaving the internship with more real-world experience, improved teamwork abilities, and a clearer idea of how I want to progress towards a full-time cybersecurity position.
