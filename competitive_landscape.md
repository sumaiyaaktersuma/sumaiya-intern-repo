- *Strengths:* Pomodoro-style timers, scheduled lockouts, customisable blocklists, and nearly impossible to override.

## Reflection

**What sets Focus Bear apart?**  
- In a single app, *distraction control* and *habit/routine guidance* are combined.    
- It was developed with neurodivergent productivity issues (particularly ASD/ADHD) in mind.  
- Designed to promote longer-lasting routines and more healthful work schedules rather than just brief periods of intense concentration.  
- A consistent user experience across mobile and desktop devices.   

**Why would I pick Focus Bear as a user?**  
- I needed structure and accountability if I wanted more than just blocking.  
- The habit/routine reminders feel like support rather than restriction.  
- Built to encourage sustainable habits and healthier work rhythms, not only short-term focus bursts.  

**A feature others have that Focus Bear lacks:**  
- Cold Turkey’s *“Frozen” mode* — the ability to completely lock down the computer for maximum accountability.  

**One improvement Focus Bear could make:**  
- Introduce a *smarter sync system* so routines and focus sessions begin simultaneously across devices without manual setup.
