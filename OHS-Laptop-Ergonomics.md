#  Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) — Desk-Based Work (Laptop)

##  Goal
Set up a safe, ergonomic laptop workspace and build habits that prevent strain and discomfort.

## Research & Learn

###  Risks of using only a laptop (no external monitor/keyboard)
- **Neck & upper-back strain:** screen is too low → constant neck flexion (“tech neck”).
- **Wrist/hand issues:** cramped keyboard/trackpad → wrist extension/ulnar deviation, tendon irritation.
- **Shoulder tension:** elbows held too high/forward; rounded posture.
- **Low-back pain:** static sitting, poor lumbar support.
- **Eye strain & headaches:** small screen, glare, long viewing times without breaks.
- **Reduced typing precision & speed:** compact keyboard and touchpad.

###  Equipment that helps (prioritized for laptop users)
- **Laptop stand** (or stack of books) to raise screen to eye height.
- **External keyboard + mouse** (full-size or compact; consider a vertical or trackball mouse).
- **External monitor** (optional but ideal; 21–27″).
- **Adjustable chair** with lumbar support and height/armrest adjustment.
- **Sit-stand desk** (or add a stand pad) to vary posture.
- **Footrest** (or sturdy box) if feet don’t rest flat.
- **Document holder** aligned with monitor if referencing papers.
- **Anti-glare tools**: matte screen filter, task light positioned to avoid glare.

### Core setup adjustments
- **Monitor height:** Top of screen at or slightly **below eye level**
- **Viewing distance:** **An arm’s length** (50–70 cm).
- **Keyboard/mouse:** Close to body;shoulders relaxed; wrists neutral.
- **Chair:**
- Height so **feet are flat** (or on footrest).
- **Desk height:** At/just below elbow height when typing.
- **Lighting:** Avoid glare (perpendicular to windows), use task lighting for documents.

### Daily habits that reduce impact
- **Break rhythm:** Every **30–45 min**, take a **1–3 min micro-break** (stand, walk, shoulder rolls).
- **20-20-20 for eyes:** Every 20 min, look 20 ft/6 m away for 20 s; blink intentionally.
- **Posture reset cue:** “Ears over shoulders, shoulders down & back, ribs over hips, feet flat.”
- **Move variety:** Alternate sitting/standing; change mouse hands for brief periods if comfortable.
- **Hydration & pacing:** Water nearby; avoid long no-movement stretches.
- **Tech aids:** Use Focus Bear or OS timers for **movement, eye, and posture checks**.

> If you have pain or numbness, consult your OHS lead or a clinician.


## Reflection

### Equipment changes I can make
- To bring the screen up to eye level, add a **laptop stand**.
- Make use of a **mouse**  and a **external keyboard** 
- Chair adjustment: lower armrests to relieve shoulders; lumbar support activated.
- Until a suitable footrest arrives, make do with a box.
- Long-term: for dual-screen work, take into consideration **an external monitor**.
### Behaviour changes I will implement
- **Micro-breaks every 30–45 min**; brief walk/stretch.
- **20-20-20** eye breaks and reduce screen glare.
- **Posture check** on each return from a break (neutral wrists, shoulders relaxed).
- **Alternate postures** (sit/stand) 2–3× per day.

### How I’ll remind myself
- **Focus Bear setup:**
  - Movement Breaks: every **40 min**, 2-min stretch/walk.
  - Posture Check: **15-sec** prompt after each break.
  - Eye Break: **20-20-20** prompt every **20 min** during long reading tasks.

## Task

### Adjust your laptop setup (quick checklist)
- Raise laptop on stand/books so screen top ≈ eye level.
- Plug in **external keyboard & mouse**; place close to body.
-  Set chair height so **feet flat**; add footrest if needed.
-  Align screen **arm’s length** away; tilt to reduce glare.
- Place frequently used items within **forearm reach**.

###  Identify one equipment upgrade
**Chosen item:** _External keyboard & mouse_ (biggest impact on wrist/shoulder comfort).  
_Fallback if budget-limited:_ _Laptop stand + borrowed keyboard_.

### Use posture & movement reminders for one full workday
Create a quick log:
## Day-1 
 **Date** 18/08/2025
 **Reminders Used** Movement + Eye + Posture
 **What changed?**  Stood 3×, fewer neck aches
**Note** Shoulders relaxed by PM

###  Document at least one workspace or habit change
- **Change made:** Raised laptop ~12 cm on stand; added external keyboard & vertical mouse. 
- **Result after 1 day:** Less neck flexion, wrists feel neutral; needed reminders to relax shoulders.
- **Next tweak:** will update soon.
