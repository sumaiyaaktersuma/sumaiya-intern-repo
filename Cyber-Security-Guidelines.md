# Cyber Security

##  Goal
To understand how to keep company and user data secure by following cyber security best practices.



## Why is this important?
Cyber security breaches can cause **data leaks, financial loss, identity theft, and reputational damage**. Since Focus Bear handles sensitive user data, every team member plays an important role in keeping information safe. Practicing good cyber hygiene ensures both **company safety** and **user trust**.


## Research & Learn

### Common cyber security threats in a remote work environment
- **Phishing attacks** – fake emails or links that trick you into sharing passwords or downloading malware from open source. 
- **Weak passwords** – easily guessed passwords that make accounts vulnerable for example, using your name as a password.   
- **Unsecured Wi-Fi** – working on public Wi-Fi without a VPN exposes data to hackers for example, restaurent wi-fi or airport free wi-fi.   
- **Device theft** – stolen laptops/phones without strong security can expose sensitive data.  
- **Malware & ransomware** – malicious software that can lock or steal files.  
- **Social engineering** – attackers tricking people into giving away confidential information.  


### Best practices for keeping devices and accounts secure
- Use **strong, unique passwords** for each account.  
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.  
- Keep devices updated (OS, apps, antivirus).  
- Avoid installing unauthorized apps or extensions.  
- Only use **trusted Wi-Fi** or a **VPN** when remote.  
- Regularly back up important data.  


### Why is it important to lock your computer when away?
- Prevents **unauthorized access** if someone physically uses your device.  
- Protects sensitive work and personal data.  
- Even a few minutes of unattended access could lead to data theft or misuse.  


### Handling phishing attempts and suspicious links
- Check the **sender’s email address** carefully.  
- Hover over links to verify the **real URL** before clicking.  
- Don’t download unexpected attachments.  
- Report suspicious messages to your manager or IT team.  
- When in doubt: **don’t click, don’t reply, and verify first**.  


### What makes a strong password?
- At least **12 characters long**.  
- Includes **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
- Avoids personal info (birthdays, names, pets).  
- Use a **password manager** to store and generate secure passwords.  


### Importance of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Provides an **extra layer of protection** beyond your password.  
- Prevents account takeovers even if your password is stolen.  
- Should be enabled on all **work accounts, email, and financial apps**.  



## Reflection

### Security measures I currently follow
- I use unique passwords for most accounts which icludes upper case, number and pound sign.
- My laptop auto-locks when idle.  
- I’m careful about phishing emails. 
- giving my bank details in a random shopping website.  

### Where I can improve
- I need to start using a **password manager** consistently.  
- I should enable **2FA** on all accounts, not just a few.  

### Making secure behavior a habit
- Always lock my computer/phone when stepping away.  
- Regularly review account security settings.  

### Steps to secure passwords and accounts
- Store all passwords in a trusted password manager.  
- Frequently change my old password.
- Enable 2FA on email, Slack, GitHub, and other work tools.  

### What I would do if I suspected a security breach
- Immediately **change passwords** for affected accounts.  
- Report it to the Focus Bear team/IT.  
- Check for unauthorized logins or devices.  
- Run antivirus/malware scans on my device.  


## Task

### Actions taken
- Updated all work accounts with **strong, unique passwords**.  
- Enabled **2FA** on Slack, GitHub, and company email.  
- Set my laptop and phone to auto-lock after 2 minutes of inactivity.  
- Installed and set up a **password manager** for secure storage.  

### One new cyber security habit I will follow
Rather than writing down or repeating strong passwords, I will **always utilise a password manager to create and store them**. This keeps all of my accounts safe and makes them simpler to handle.
