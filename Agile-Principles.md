# üöÄ Working in an Agile Team ‚Äì Reflection

## Goal
Understand how Focus Bear‚Äôs agile team operates, including roles, workflows, and collaboration practices.


## Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

### Research & Learn

**What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?**  
Agile is an iterative approach to software development focused on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Unlike traditional project management (Waterfall), which follows a linear sequence (requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy), Agile delivers work in small increments and adapts continuously to change.  

**Core Values of Agile (Agile Manifesto):**  
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.  
4. Responding to change over following a plan.  

**Differences Between Scrum and Kanban:**  
- **Scrum**:  
  - Uses fixed-length sprints (usually 2 weeks).  
  - Defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team).  
  - Sprint ceremonies (planning, daily standups, review, retrospective).  
- **Kanban**:  
  - Continuous workflow, no fixed-length sprints.  
  - Focuses on visualising tasks on a board.  
  - Emphasises WIP (work-in-progress) limits to prevent overload.  

**Why Focus Bear uses Kanban instead of Scrum:**  
- The team works on a **continuous flow of tasks** (bug fixes, new features, QA cycles) rather than time-boxed sprints.  
- Kanban gives more flexibility to adapt priorities quickly.  
- It suits a small, cross-functional team better, without the overhead of Scrum ceremonies.  
## üìù Reflection

**Biggest Benefits of Agile:**  
- Quicker feedback loops and change adaption.  
- Constant work visibility helps to avoid misunderstandings.  
- Interdepartmental cooperation (QA, devs, PMs, security).
**Challenges of Agile:**  
- Without discipline, it could feel disorganised.  
- Priorities can change quickly, which can lead to misunderstandings if not well explained.  
- Strong communication is necessary to prevent bottlenecks. 

**How Agile Principles Help My Role (Cyber Security Analyst):**  
- Instead of waiting for a final release, I can provide **continuous security feedback** through iterative work.  
- I can keep track of where testing and reviews are required with the help of Kanban.  
- Working together guarantees that security factors are incorporated early on rather than only at the very end.  
## üõ†Ô∏è Task

**Main Differences Between Scrum and Kanban (in my own words):**  
- Kanban is more of a *flow system* where tasks move continually, whereas Scrum is more like working in *sprints* with a set rhythm and roles.  
- Scrum necessitates more preparation and ceremonies, while Kanban emphasises visualising work and minimising multitasking.  
- Scrum works better for teams delivering significant features in fixed cycles, while Kanban is more adaptable when priorities change often.  
**Agile Principle Most Useful for My Work:**  
*‚ÄúResponding to change over following a plan.‚Äù*  
Risks and threats in cybersecurity change swiftly. This idea serves as a reminder to me to remain flexible, keep an eye out for emerging threats, and change security procedures in response to shifting circumstances.
