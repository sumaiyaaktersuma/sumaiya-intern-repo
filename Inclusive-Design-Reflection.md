# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## Goal
To understand how to interact respectfully and responsibly when working with or designing for vulnerable populations, including neurodivergent individuals such as those with ADHD and Autism.

## Research & Learn

### Who are considered vulnerable populations?
- **Neurodivergent individuals** (ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, etc.)
- **People with mental health challenges** (anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc.)
- **Individuals with physical or sensory disabilities** (visual, auditory, motor impairments)
- **Elderly users** who may struggle with technology
- **Non-native language speakers** or people with low digital literacy

**Challenges they face in digital spaces:**
- Overwhelming interfaces with too many distractions
- Poor accessibility (tiny buttons, confusing navigation, lack of captions)
- Unclear instructions or jargon-heavy content
- Tools that assume one-size-fits-all productivity methods
- Frustration or shame when they “fall behind” due to executive functioning struggles

### Ethical considerations when designing for neurodivergent individuals
- **Avoid cognitive overload** – keep UI clean, simple, and consistent.
- **Respect sensory needs** – avoid flashing animations, loud sounds, or clutter.
- **Offer choice and flexibility** – allow users to customize notifications, timing, and workflows.
- **Inclusive language** – use clear, supportive wording instead of judgmental or shaming terms.
- **Privacy and dignity** – don’t stigmatize or single out users for their differences.

### Making interactions & content accessible for ADHD/Autism
- Use **short, simple instructions** instead of long text blocks.
- Provide **predictable navigation** (no sudden layout changes).
- Break tasks into **small, clear steps**.
- Add **visual aids** (icons, progress bars, checkmarks).
- Offer **positive reinforcement** instead of negative alerts.
- Allow **pauses or breaks** during guided tasks.

### Supporting neurodivergent team members
- Be **clear and direct** in communication (avoid vague phrases like “later” or “soon”).
- Respect different working styles (some may need deep focus time, others need flexibility).
- Provide written instructions in addition to verbal ones.
- Encourage asynchronous collaboration to reduce pressure in meetings.
- Check in supportively, not critically.
- Foster an environment where asking for clarification is normal and safe.

## Reflection

### 1. Adjusting my communication style
- I am able to communicate using language that is **clear, basic, and direct**.  
Stay clear of confusing or cruel language when communicating in writing.  
- Give **step-by-step instructions** rather than lengthy informational passages.  
Be patient and refrain from hurrying users or teammates.  

### 2. Common UX or communication pitfalls 
- Using negative or judgmental wording (“You failed to stay focused”).  
- Assuming everyone processes information the same way.  
- Poor accessibility (e.g., no captions, unclear icons).  

### 3. One practical change I can make
I will **always break down tasks and instructions into small, clear steps** so users and teammates don’t feel overwhelmed. For example, instead of “Set up your workflow,” I would say:  
1. Open the settings menu.  
2. Tap on “Workflows.”  
3. Select “Add new workflow.”  
- which will be more specific. 

##  Task

### First-person account research
Individuals with ADHD have expressed their annoyance with productivity apps that:
 - Take too long to launch.  
 - Make them feel bad if they fail to complete a task.  

Employ inflexible systems that are unable to adjust to changes in focus or energy levels.  

### One design/communication improvement for Focus Bear
Add **gentle encouragement and flexibility**:  
- Instead of “You didn’t finish your ritual,” use:  
   “You completed 3 out of 5 tasks — great progress! Want to try again later?”  

This reinforces effort, not failure.

### Practice supportive response
**Hypothetical User:**  
“I keep forgetting to finish my rituals. I feel like I’m failing every day.”  

**Supportive Response:**  
“Thanks for sharing this with us — you’re definitely not failing. Building new habits takes time, and it’s completely normal to miss steps. Focus Bear is designed to help you make progress at your own pace. You might find it helpful to start with just one or two rituals instead of the full list. Every small step counts, and we’re here to support you.”
