# Focus Bear App Testing Feedback

## Key Issues
1. **Checkbox Confusion** – Tapping a task (e.g., "Drink a glass of water") plays a video instead of simply checking it off. This feels unintuitive.  
2. **Unclear Onboarding** – No quick intro explaining how habits + videos work.  
3. **Button Wording** – “Continue Drink a glass of water” sounds awkward.  
4. **No Visible Progress** – Finishing tasks doesn’t show clear progress (bar, %).  
5. **“Get Motivated” Button** – Purpose isn’t explained.  

##  Suggested Improvements
- Separate task completion from video playback.  
- Add a short onboarding guide (3–4 steps).  
- Improve button text (e.g., “Next: Drink a glass of water”).  
- Show progress tracking during rituals.  
- I Explain “Get Motivated” button.  

##  Conclusion
Focus Bear is helpful but confusing for new users.  
Main fix: **make checkboxes mark tasks complete first, with video optional**.
