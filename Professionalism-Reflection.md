# Professionalism at Focus Bear – Reflection

## Research & Learn

### Examples of Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour in a Casual Work Environment

**Professional Behaviour**
- Being on time for meetings, even if they’re casual.  
- Using clear, respectful, and concise communication.  
- Actively listening to teammates, not interrupting.  
- Offering help when someone seems stuck.  
- Keeping commitments and updating teammates if something changes.  

**Unprofessional Behaviour**
- Talking over others or dismissing their ideas.  
- Using sarcasm or a hostile tone in chat.  
- Ignoring deadlines without communication.  
- Showing up unprepared for meetings.  

### Respectful Communication in Remote Teams
- Use a **positive, collaborative tone** in messages (e.g., “Can we try this?” instead of “This is wrong”).  
- Acknowledge others’ contributions, even in async chat.  
- When disagreeing, focus on the **idea, not the person**.  
- Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid idioms that may confuse others.  
- Respond in a timely way, or let teammates know when you’ll get back to them.  

### Giving and Receiving Feedback Professionally
- **Give feedback**:  
  - Be specific and focus on actions, not personality.  
  - Use “I noticed…” or “I suggest…” instead of blame.  
  - Balance constructive feedback with acknowledgment of what went well.  

- **Receive feedback**:  
  - Assume good intent.  
  - Listen without interrupting or reacting defensively.  
  - Ask clarifying questions if something isn’t clear.  
  - Thank the person for their perspective, even if it’s tough to hear.  

## Reflection

**Great Teamwork & Professionalism I’ve Seen**  
- The most effective teams I’ve worked with combined **kindness, accountability, and humor**.  
- People were open to exchanging ideas and asking for assistance, respected one another's time, and spoke clearly.
- Positive feedback was offered, which encouraged and secured teamwork.  

**Steps I Can Take to Communicate Clearly, Respectfully, and Inclusively**  
- Avoid using slang and speak simply and directly.  
- Verify the tone of your writing before emailing it.  
- Ask your more reserved teammates for their opinions.  
- Make use of inclusive language by using "we" rather than "you should."  

**How I Can Help Create a Positive, Fun, and Professional Environment**  
- Give teammates encouraging shoutouts and acknowledge minor victories.  
- To maintain a positive attitude, correctly share pleasant humour.  
- If someone is having difficulties, be patient and empathetic.  

**Preparing Effectively for Meetings**  
- Examine the materials and agenda in advance.  
- Bring questions or notes to ensure that the conversation stays on topic.  
- Be prepared to provide quick updates on my work.  

**Being Proactive During My Internship**  
- Show initiative by making suggestions for enhancements or taking on little jobs without waiting for approval.  
- Monitor my development and provide updates without request.  
- Pose meaningful queries that demonstrate your interest and dedication.  

**Following Up With Colleagues/Supervisors**  
- I'll send a courteous reminder if I require information after a fair amount of time, such as 24 to 48 hours.  
- I'll escalate by tagging the person or setting up a quick check-in if there's still no answer.  
- Only in cases when the problem is urgent, preventing development, or connected to a major conduct violation would I take it further (for example, to a manager or CEO).  
**What I Won’t Do**  
- I won't speak negatively or sarcastically in chat.  
- I won't disregard messages or remain silent in the face of blockers.  
- I won't spread rumours, assume anything, or disparage teammates.  
- I will not treat professionalism as "rigid"; instead, I will strike a balance between accountability and being personable and compassionate.  


##  Task
- From the onboarding deck, I have taken note of Jeremy's phone number.  
- I'll only use it in the event that I witness **serious violations of professional conduct** or pressing problems that need to be addressed.
