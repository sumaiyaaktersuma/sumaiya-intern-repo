# Roles in an Agile Team – Reflection

## Research & Learn

**Key Roles in an Agile Team**  
- **Developers**: Build features, fix bugs, and deliver working code.  
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Test software to catch bugs, ensure performance, security, and reliability.  
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Defines vision, priorities, and requirements based on user needs and business goals.  
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM/Scrum Master)**: Facilitates meetings, removes blockers, and ensures Agile practices are followed.  
- **Supporting Roles**:  
  - **Stakeholders** – Provide business or customer insights.  
  - **UX Designers** – Ensure usability and accessibility.  
  - **Customer Support** – Relay user feedback and issues.  

**Kanban vs. Scrum Collaboration**  
- **Scrum**: Structured sprints, fixed roles, daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives. Roles collaborate in short cycles with defined deliverables.  
- **Kanban**: Continuous workflow, fewer time-boxed events. Collaboration focuses on managing work-in-progress (WIP) limits and ensuring smooth task flow.


## Reflection

**My Role – Cyber Security Analyst**  
Finding and minimising security threats during the development and testing phases is my responsibility. 
- I help by checking setups and code for vulnerabilities.  
- Helping QA make sure that acceptance criteria include security testing.  
- Encouraging developers to use safe coding techniques.  
- Risk-based feature prioritisation advice for PMs.

**Interaction with Other Roles**  
- There is overlap in the testing scope with **QA**. Whereas QA concentrates on functionality, I concentrate on security. Together, we make sure that security and quality are taken care of before to release.  
- Working with **Developers**: I point out flaws and suggest solutions.  
- With **PMs/Agile PMs**: I draw attention to possible hazards that could compromise compliance or delivery schedules.  

## Task

**How My Role Fits Into the Agile Team**  
As a *security enabler*, I work with the Agile team to make sure security is incorporated into all stages, from planning to testing to deployment. I want security to be a shared responsibility rather than an afterthought.  

**Collaboration Focus**  
I work closely with **QA** a lot. I can: 
- Provide threat models and checklists to direct their test cases in order to enhance teamwork.  
- Participate in their testing sessions to identify any weaknesses.  
- Quick feedback loops should be established to prevent releases from being blocked by security fixes.
